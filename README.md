# MS2-datasets-for-prototyping
Contains several small datasets that can be used for machine learning prototyping.

Even though many applications in the cross-section between machine learning and mass spectrometry are published, there are normally no ready-to-use datasets available. Datasets that are available are usually very large and not suited for machine learning prototyping. In my eyes, it is a waste of time if every researcher in this interdisciplinary area spends months generating their own dataset just for model prototyping. Therefore, the aim of this repository is to provide high-quality, small (can be run on a laptop) MS2 datasets, which are linked to chemical properties like toxicology or bioactivity and, most importantly, are ready to use instantaneously with tools such as matchms.

My vision is to simplify the hurdle for model development and to enhance the time that can be spent on innovative model development instead of data mining. Furthermore, the datasets provided here can be used as benchmarks.
